// Package sherpa is a minimal binding to sherpa-onnx's C API
// (https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx, Apache-2.0) for offline text
// to speech (VITS/Piper, Kitten, Kokoro and ZipVoice models) and speech
// recognition (Whisper, NeMo transducers such as Parakeet, SenseVoice)
// on the CPU, with Silero voice activity detection to cut long
// recordings into utterances.
//
// The binding is compiled on Android, and on desktops with the
// "sherpa" build tag; it links against libsherpa-onnx-c-api.so from
// third_party/sherpa-onnx (see tools/fetchsherpa). Without it,
// Available is false and New fails, so normal desktop builds need no
// native library. c-api.h is the header of the release named in
// tools/fetchsherpa.
